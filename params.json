{"name":"Zhuojie Zhou","tagline":"Data geek","body":"![Profile](http://i.minus.com/jbfSYvbyf5R0mt.png)\r\n\r\nI'm a programmer, cs researcher & data geek from GWU, Washington, DC. My interest varies from deep web data mining, graph sampling to full stack web development. I spend my evenings building things I loved.\r\n\r\n### DM_GReader: Data mining on Google Reader [source](https://github.com/zhouzhuojie/DM_GReader)\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, there was an awesome place for people to kill their time: Google Reader. Though it suddenly died without notice, I still missed those days with 1000+ feeds coming everyday. Inspired by summerly, I tried to use K-MEANS and Cover-Tree to generate the most representative samples out of the 1000+ feeds per day to give myself of short list to read. I am now trying to migrate to Feedly if possible.\r\n\r\n### Hast: Live markdown presentation [website](http://hast.me) [source](https://github.com/zhouzhuojie/hast)\r\n\r\nLive presentation is never done easier before. Hast is a WYSIWYG markdown flavor presentation tool made for everyone! We love markdown, did I mention it? It uses github style markdown. It quickly does the real time broadcasting and hot pushing changes. Hast uses Meteor, DeckJS, aceEditor, etc. I just love how simple it is.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
